            <p><strong>How Are Benefit Amounts Calculated?</strong></p>

            <p>California Paid Family Leave provides approximately 55 percent of your salary (from $50 up to $1,173 weekly). Your employer may allow you to use vacation, sick, paid time off, or other leave to supplement your PFL benefits to receive up to 100 percent pay. In January 2018, the wage replacement rate increases to approximately 60 to 70 percent of your salary.</p>
            <p>The benefit amount is calculated from your highest quarterly earnings over the past 5 to 18 months. The Employment Development Department has an online calculator at <a href=" http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Calculator.htm"<strong>edd.ca.gov/PFL_Calculator</strong><a> that can help you estimate your weekly benefit amount.</p>
            <p><strong>Job Protection </strong></p>
            <p>California Paid Family Leave does not provide job protection or return to work rights. However, job protection may be provided if your employer has to follow the federal FMLA or the CFRA. Also, notify your employer of the reason for taking leave according to your company’s leave policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply for Benefits </strong></p>
            <p>
                Apply for Paid Family Leave benefits online using SDI Online. Employers and physicians/practitioners can also submit claim information through SDI Online. Visit edd.ca.gov/Disability for more information. You may also file using a paper form. Visit edd.ca.gov/Forms to request a paper Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits, DE 2501F form.
            </p>
            <p>For bonding claims, be sure to provide a proof of relationship document with your claim. For caregiving claims, be sure to provide a physician/practitioner’s certification.</p>
            <p>If you are currently receiving Disability Insurance pregnancy-related benefits, it is not necessary to  request a Paid Family Leave claim form. Claim filing information will be sent through your SDI Online  account or via mail when your pregnancy-related disability claim ends.</p>
            <p>If you are covered by a voluntary plan, contact your employer to obtain information about your coverage and instructions on how to apply for benefits.</p>
