<p>Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill is committed to providing a workplace for you that is safe, free of drugs and alcohol, free of theft and violence, and free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. If you ever think we are not achieving this objective, we want to know.</p>
<br /><p>
In most cases, it is preferable for you to use the normal chain of command to communicate your concerns to management. This means talking first to your immediate manager or manager whenever possible. However, we understand there may be times when you would feel uncomfortable talking to your immediate manager or manager about certain team member-related issues. As a result, we have arranged with a highly respected human resources consulting firm to establish a toll-free We Want To Know Hotline® for any of our team members to use when they would feel more comfortable talking to an independent third-party.</p>
<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"> <li>&rarr;We want to know when there is unlawful discrimination.
</li><li> &rarr;We want to know when there is unlawful harassment.
</li><li> &rarr;We want to know when there are safety hazards that need to be corrected.
</li><li> &rarr;We want to know when team members, guests, vendors or others are stealing.
</li><li> &rarr;We want to know when team members are using drugs or alcohol on the job.
</li><li> &rarr;We want to know when there is a threat of violence.
</li></ul>

<br /><p>When you call We Want To Know Hotline &rarr;, you will have the opportunity to speak openly and honestly about any of the above team member-related issues. Hotline staff will listen objectively to what you have to say, ask questions and gather information. Within two business days of your call, a confidential report will be sent to Eric Anders, President of the company.</p>

<br />
<p>Based on the information you provide, we will conduct a complete and comprehensive review of the matter. What you say will be held in confidence to the maximum extent possible.  You may decide to give your name or remain anonymous – it’s your choice. However, if you do not give your name, we may be limited in our ability to fully review the matter. For this reason, you are encouraged to give your name and as much detailed information as possible. Based on the results of our review, appropriate corrective action will be taken. At your request, you will receive confidential notification at the completion of the review. Team members will not be retaliated against for calling We Want To Know Hotline &reg;.</p>

<br />
<p>The telephone number for the <em>We Want To Know Hotline</em> is <strong> 800-990-8384.</strong> This information can also be found on the posting about the <em> We Want To Know Hotline</em> at the restaurant.</p>
